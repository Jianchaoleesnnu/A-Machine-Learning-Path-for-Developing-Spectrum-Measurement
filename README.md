# A-Machine-Learning-Path-for-Developing-Spectrum-Measurement
Abstract: The spectroscopy measurement is one of main pathways for exploring and understanding the nature. Today, machine learning (ML) based artificial intelligence technology may remould its styles. Various ML algorithms contained huge neural networks seem to be able to substitute many expensive and complicated spectrum devices. In this work, we proposed a ML strategy on non-destructive measurement of absorbance curves of complex chemical samples. During the process, an exceedingly-simplified imaging spectrum device was used to produce large data - colour scattering spectrum - needed for machine learning. And the results showed that a well-trained ML model could predict accurately the absorption curves of complex samples, suggesting its application value in many related fields.
